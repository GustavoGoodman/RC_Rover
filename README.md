# RC Rover controlled with Flysky RC Controller
The RC Rover is a Remote controlled Rover using a Flysky RC controller. The size of the Rover is about 1/10 scale from the real perseverance rover. We used an aluminum bar for the frame and we also use 3d printed parts for the suspension and the wheels. The rover is equipped with six 12V DC motors, four 25kg Servos, Flysky Rc transmitter and powered with an 11.1V 5200 mAH LI-PO battery. The rover uses Ackerman theory and the Rocker-bogie system suspension to support the movement and the mechanism of the rover.
